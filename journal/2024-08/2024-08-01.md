### Journal entry
I felt good throughout the day. I stayed consistent with all of my rules and passed my first funded account! I took a trade on my phone but I still made sure it was set accordingly. If I do trades on my phone in the future, I'll make sure to set auto-breakeven.

# Dayside (8:30 AM to 3:00 PM Central)
## /MNQ 9:55 AM to 10:36 AM
- Per trade Habits:
  - - [x] Did you only risk max 1R?
  - - [x] Did you follow rules for moving stops? 21-minute rule. Auto-breakeven after +0.6R
  - - [x] Did you follow this rule: when doing the trade setup, if the hinge point was above/below the 10/20/30/40/60/120 or 4/6/8/12/16/24/48 stop then don't take the trade?
    - Set the stop at 0.25 points above the recent high. Per my trading plan, it should be 1.25 points above the high
  - - [x] Did you do at least 1:1.2 risk to reward ratio?  
- Extra notes/thoughts:
  - I woke up a bit late and saw the trade on my phone. Rushed to get to the computer and set a limit sell. Had I been on the charts at the right time, I could've gotten in with a stop sell. Also, there was a similar set up on /MES which I would've gotten in had I been on the computer at that time.

  - - [x] Did you do at least 1:1.2 risk to reward ratio?
- Extra notes/thoughts:
  - Auto breakeven was hit. Took this trade on my phone in the gym. Didn't set automatic breakeven so I had to do it manually. I also could have closed the trade early to meet my profit goal (i.e. pass the funded account) but instead I followed my rules. I should be proud about that.
