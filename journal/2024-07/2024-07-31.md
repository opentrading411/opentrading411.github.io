### Journal entry
I felt a little tired throughout the day today. I should have been studying for the test more but I still took trades. During the first /MNQ trade of the day, I got triggered in and I should have set my stop lower. Got triggered in and out within seconds.

I almost had a successful day. A successful day is a day where I follow all of my habits. P/L is not indicative of success.
